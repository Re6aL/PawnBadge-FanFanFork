	<description>The fan fan fork of the mod "Pawn Badge" originally by Rangel Reale which allows adding up to two informative badges to the colonist bar.
I made a version with all badges i need and mostly my own which are better. why collecting this all unnessesary addons.
Requires Harmony (versions 1.1/1.2 only).

Credits:
- Rangel Reale, the original author of the mod.
- LeninsCat, for fixing the manifest error message and providing excellent updated textures.
(Яебал: this textures are shit so i deleted them how thefuck they are exellent fuck this shit, i made my own and kept some from original and pirated a lot from addons. you not supposed to read this but if you do - have a good day!)</description>
